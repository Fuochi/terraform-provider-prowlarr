# Prowlarr Provider

The Prowlarr provider is used to interact with any [Prowlarr](https://prowlarr.com/) installation. You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it. Use the left navigation to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "prowlarr" {
  url     = "http://example.prowlarr.tv:8989"
  api_key = "APIkey-example"
}
```

## Example Usage when behind proxy
```terraform
provider "prowlarr" {
  url           = "http://example.prowlarr.tv:8989"
  api_key       = "APIkey-example"

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key for Prowlarr authentication. Can be specified via the `PROWLARR_API_KEY` environment variable.
- `authorization` (String, Sensitive) This token is passed as an authentication header, complementing the `api_key`. Set it using the `PROWLARR_AUTHORIZATION` environment variable. Both `authorization` and `api_key` are required for complete authentication.
- `url` (String) Full Prowlarr URL with protocol and port (e.g. `https://test.prowlarr.com:9696`). You should **NOT** supply any path (`/api`), the SDK will use the appropriate paths. Can be specified via the `PROWLARR_URL` environment variable.
